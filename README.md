## How To

**Add more pictures to paint**:

1. Open Android Studio
2. Click right on `res` > `drawable`
3. Click right > `New` > `Image Asset`
4. Make sure to name your image asset starting with `outline` followed by the
    number, underscore and name.
    Also, we do need PNG images of size 600x480, so the app stays small.

**Translate the app**: Go to [Transifex] and [read the Documentation].
