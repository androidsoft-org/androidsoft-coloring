## Adding Images

The easiest way to add images to the app is to fork the [gallery] and
add some images there.
You can request to add the gallery to the app by adding the URL to
the [Settings].
Galleries can also be added manually to the app in the settings
of the app.

If you fork the gallery, do not worry: Images will not be displayed twice.
They have a unique name depending on the folder they are in.

If you request to add new images to the gallery,
please make sure they are not violent, frightening or in other ways
controversal as kids should be able to use the app unattended.
Best if you ask your child which images it would like to paint.
I am happy to inlcude these, too.

What to keep in mind when creating an image:
- Added images should be `600px` wide.
- They consist of black and white pixels.
    While it is possible to already add colors, they may be
    transformed to black and white by the app and only be visible as preview.
- The outlines should be `6` to `10` pixels wide.
  This allows scaling down images for fast drawing on smaller phones.
  If they are too small, it might be that areas are joined i.e.
  coloring the head will also color the background.
  

If an app contains many galleries, the user defined galleries are
more important than the built-in galleries.

We can pull the translations then.
